# Session plan

(Catherine: I think it might be a good idea to assign rough timings as I think this current plan may take longer than the alloted session)

## Facilitators

* Neil Chue Hong, Software Sustainability Institute
* Catherine Jones, STFC
* Andrew Nesbitt, Libraries.io

## Introductions *(10 minutes)*

### Summary

General introductions from facilitators *(5 minutes)*

Participant introductions *(5 minutes)*

Each person says:
* their name
* where they're from
* one thing they're looking to learn from this workshop

Note: if there are a lot of people attending the session (>10) ask them to split 
into smaller groups and do the introductions within the groups.

### Learning Goal

1. Understand the background of the attendees and how you relate to them.


## Activity - Identifying Successful Software *(10 minutes)*

### Summary

1. Introduce exercise and break into pairs. *(1 minute)*
2. One person in the pair: *(3 minutes)*
  * Chooses a piece of research software / scientific software they think is successful
  * Describes to their partner what characteristics or measures make them think it is successful
3. Swap and do they same for the other person in the pair *(3 minutes)*
4. Discuss within the pair whether they had the same ways of identifying successful software, and where they differed. *(3 minutes)*

### Learning Goal

1. Understanding how different people judge the success of software

## Discussion - How Do People Identify Success *(10 minutes)*

### Summary

A group discussion of how people found this exercise, what they noticed in discussing with their partner. *(10 minutes)*

Guided by the following questions:
* Were there any characteristics that everyone in your group thought were important?
* Were there any characteristics mentioned by someone that were unexpected?
* Does the absence of a characteristic always mean that the software is unsuccessful?
* Are any characteristics easier to measure than others?
* Do you think any characteristics more accurate than others?

### Learning Goal

1. Understand the main priorities
2. Reflect on the process 


## Input - What are existing models of measuring success *(10 minutes)*

### Summary

Present a brief overview of existing models of success, including metrics used by others.

Note: Cut down this section if running over, and point people to material in slides / references.

### Learning Goal

1. Provide a grounding in existing work in this area to participants.
2. Understand where to get further information.

## Deepening - Measuring Software Exercise *(15 minutes)*

### Summary

An exercise in small groups where each group aims to come up with a set of measures to judge software, 
and attempts to apply it to one of a set of pre-chosen pieces of research software by creating appropriate metrics.

#### Online rating exercise ####

1. Using the set of measures suggested earlier in the session, choose three that as a group you think are the most important to you
2. Create a set of metrics that would allow you to rate a piece of software against that measure. For example: if your measure is "community growth", you might think of metrics such as "number of contributors", "number of issues opened".
3. Use these to rank the following set of software:
  a. scipy
  b. spyder
  c. R.utils
  
  
#### Offline rating exercise ####

1. Using the set of measures suggested earlier in the session, choose three that as a group you think are the most important to you
2. Create a set of metrics that would allow you to rate a piece of software against that measure. For example: if your measure is "community growth", you might think of metrics such as "number of contributors", "number of issues opened".
3. Apply it to a piece of software that you are familiar with.

### Learning Goal

1. Understand how to choose appropriate measures and create sensible metrics.
2. Gain an understanding of how easy it is to use particular measures, both in terms of collection and interpretation.

## Synthesis - Summarising what we've learned *(5 minutes)*

### Summary

Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, 
what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.

### Learning Goal

1. Enable participants to clarify any areas of confusion.
